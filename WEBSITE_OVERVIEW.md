A: Keep WordPress running while you migrate content. Once new site is ready and tested, switch DNS. Keep WordPress backup for 30 days.

**Q: How do I add blog posts?**
A: Create new HTML files in /news/ folder following the template. Or use a CMS like Netlify CMS for easier editing.

**Q: Can I migrate email subscribers?**
A: Yes! Export from WordPress, import to Google Sheet, then sync to your email service (Mailchimp, etc.)

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: Git version control lets you roll back changes. Plus, keep WordPress running initially as backup.
